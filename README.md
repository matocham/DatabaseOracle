# DatabaseOracle
Project done with colleagues from polytechnical university

The main goal was to create database schema with views, triggers, packages, procedures and functions. Most of the schema was done by me (except last two views).
Project is based on Oracle Express 11g database with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. Java application is not finished or fully functional, because of project deadline.

Project supposed to be barter platform.
